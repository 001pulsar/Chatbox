# Chatbox---Python-LAN-Chat-Program
Chatbox - Python LAN Chat Program. The term 'LAN' can be replaced to 'WAN' just by port forwarding. Coded for college (EC CSE 05) project.

Usage:

First, you need to install these pip (pip3) modules:
socket, threading, tkinter

Then, run the server.py with python3 in the server computer and run the client.py in client computers with python3.
Connect to the server with it's IP and the respective port.

This program's basically desgined to work inside a LAN, but can be used to chat through WAN as well by using port forwarding technology.
As this is very basic, very soon I am gonna come up with a updated version of it.

ciao, 4 now.
